# OrangePiWeatherHub
OrangePiWeatherHub is a weather station using an Orange Pi Zero 3 to measure temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Data is displayed on a web page, a temperature display, and an RGB LED. The project is flexible and ideal for weather monitoring and IoT applications.

Note: This is my first project and the first time I am working with an Orange Pi. I hope to learn and improve step by step as I progress through this project.
